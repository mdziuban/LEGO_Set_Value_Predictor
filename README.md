# LEGO_Set_Value_Predictor

#### Description
This was my final project for METIS data science bootcamp. 

This project took a look at an alternative form of investment outside the typical markets (stocks, property, bitcoin) and looked at LEGO sets as an investment.  

I looked at how the value of LEGO sets have increased since they were first launched and considered multiple properties of the set to predict whether or not the set would be a good investment.  I used the S&P 500 as a benchmark for good investment.

Random Forest Classifier was used to create the model.
